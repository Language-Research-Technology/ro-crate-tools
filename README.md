# ro-crate-tools
Hi! This is a public repository for sharing ro-crate tools generated by the community. Please share away

## How to structure your contribution?

This is open to change. I can suggest:

### snake_case folder

if you upload your tool in a folder/directory in "snake_case" (lower cased). In each folder please include a README.md 

### A README.md

With detailed instructions on how to use it.

And if possible a how to contact each contributor in each readme

### The Tool

Preferable a plain text file/files such as a python script or a JavaScript file. If it is a binary file such as an excel file to prefer xlsx. If a binary file is the tool, the instructions on how to compile it, or a link to the binary.


### Suggestions and Bugs
